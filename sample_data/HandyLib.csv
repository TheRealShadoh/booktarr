But Hunter isn't really sure what being the perfect queer kid even means. Does it mean dressing up in whatever The Label tells him to wear for photo shoots and pretending never to have sex? (Unfortunately, yes.) Does it mean finding community among the queer kids at the meet-and-greets after K&T's shows? (Fortunately, yes.)

But when The Label finds out about Hunter and Kaivan, it spells trouble—for their relationship, for the perfect gay boy Hunter plays for the cameras, and, most importantly, for Hunter himself.","","13.99","Action & Adventure","4.00","06/25/2025","","","","","","","","There's No Freaking Way I'll be Your Lover!

When that life falls short of his expectations, he runs away from home to return to Sodeshima and his childhood friend, Akari. But before they can rekindle their old feelings for each other, the clock strikes six and Kanae finds himself inexplicably thrust forward four days into the future. Worse, he learns that Akito, Akari's older brother—and Kanae's childhood hero—is dead.

Except death might not be the end for Akito. As Kanae tries to fill in the four-day gap of his memories, Akari explains: he's about to relive those four days in reverse order in a phenomenon known as ""Rollback.""
