      "description": "Captivating and action-packed, From Blood and Ash is a sexy, addictive, and unexpected fantasy perfect for fans of Sarah J. Maas and Laura Thalassa. A Maiden\u2026 Chosen from birth to usher in a new era, Poppy\u2019s life has never been her own. The life of the Maiden is solitary. Never to be touched. Never to be looked upon. Never to be spoken to. Never to experience pleasure. Waiting for the day of her Ascension, she would rather be with the guards, fighting back the evil that took her family, than preparing to be found worthy by the gods. But the choice has never been hers. A Duty\u2026 The entire kingdom\u2019s future rests on Poppy\u2019s shoulders, something she\u2019s not even quite sure she wants for herself. Because a Maiden has a heart. And a soul. And longing. And when Hawke, a golden-eyed guard honor bound to ensure her Ascension, enters her life, destiny and duty become tangled with desire and need. He incites her anger, makes her question everything she believes in, and tempts her with the forbidden. A Kingdom\u2026 Forsaken by the gods and feared by mortals, a fallen kingdom is rising once more, determined to take back what they believe is theirs through violence and vengeance. And as the shadow of those cursed draws closer, the line between what is forbidden and what is right becomes blurred. Poppy is not only on the verge of losing her heart and being found unworthy by the gods, but also her life when every blood-soaked thread that holds her world together begins to unravel.

      "description": "From #1 New York Times bestselling author Brandon Sanderson, The Way of Kings, Book One of the Stormlight Archive begins an incredible new saga of epic proportion. Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter. It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them. One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable. Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity. Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war. The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making. Speak again the ancient oaths: Life before death. Strength before weakness. Journey before Destination. and return to men the Shards they once bore. The Knights Radiant must stand again.

You will be required to answer questions about traffic laws and to identify certain signs by their shape, color, or the symbol appearing on them. Don't worry because this Georgia DMV Test Manual Book can help you pass the test easily! This Georgia DMV Test Manual Book contains random multiple-choice CA permit tests with questions from the manual to help you get well prepared. As you are taking these practice exams, correct answers have been provided so that you know when you choose the wrong answer and correct yourself immediately and it will help you know how well you are doing during the test and be able to evaluate yourself. In this Georgia DMV Test Manual Book, we have 5 practical tests and each test consists of 65,54,50,135 and 46 respectively. In order to do well and become successful in this test, I would advise you to repeat each practical question until you get a consistent score above average, at least 87%. The practical questions contain over 250 questions and are a good way for preparing for an actual written test and come out successful. Also contained in this book are questions ranging from Drivers Road signs, permit practice test and each of these tests are like the actual written exams.

        "description": "Captivating and action-packed, From Blood and Ash is a sexy, addictive, and unexpected fantasy perfect for fans of Sarah J. Maas and Laura Thalassa. A Maiden\u2026 Chosen from birth to usher in a new era, Poppy\u2019s life has never been her own. The life of the Maiden is solitary. Never to be touched. Never to be looked upon. Never to be spoken to. Never to experience pleasure. Waiting for the day of her Ascension, she would rather be with the guards, fighting back the evil that took her family, than preparing to be found worthy by the gods. But the choice has never been hers. A Duty\u2026 The entire kingdom\u2019s future rests on Poppy\u2019s shoulders, something she\u2019s not even quite sure she wants for herself. Because a Maiden has a heart. And a soul. And longing. And when Hawke, a golden-eyed guard honor bound to ensure her Ascension, enters her life, destiny and duty become tangled with desire and need. He incites her anger, makes her question everything she believes in, and tempts her with the forbidden. A Kingdom\u2026 Forsaken by the gods and feared by mortals, a fallen kingdom is rising once more, determined to take back what they believe is theirs through violence and vengeance. And as the shadow of those cursed draws closer, the line between what is forbidden and what is right becomes blurred. Poppy is not only on the verge of losing her heart and being found unworthy by the gods, but also her life when every blood-soaked thread that holds her world together begins to unravel.

        "description": "Master storyteller J. V. Jones (called \"a striking writer\" by Robert Jordan) weaves an unforgettable tale of ambition, betrayal, and the indomitable strength of the human spirit. This epic fantasy of enormous scope, set on a world peopled by fascinating, compelling characters, is a sharply observed saga of a cold, splintered world on the brink. A thousand years ago, war shook the land. Now, chaos has erupted. Clans vie for dominance; dangerous, arrogant clan chiefs urge their followers into frenzied battles, killing each other and plotting the defeat of their rivals despite those among them who seek unity. But for all the vicious contention among the clans, a darker threat comes from Spire Vanis, a city with a black heart of evil, whose rulers have long sought to control the clanholds. In the midst of the chaos, a few extraordinary people wrestle with personal demons: A born killer with only love and loyalty in his heart; a young woman whose mystical destiny is shrouded in her unknown past; a young man betrayed by his own brother; and a clanswoman who would do anything to save her folk. Each alone seeks only survival, but together they hold the keys to a world's salvation. At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",

Reunited with his father after twenty-two years, Kael must find the balance between protecting him and confronting the enemy who stands between them and their home world. The timelessness of the In-Between has stolen the years that separated Kael and Adair by age, leaving them as distant equals. Having glimpsed Kael\u2019s destiny from the Eternal Realm, Adair struggles to find his role in the life of a son who no longer needs him. Through a global maze of counterintelligence and espionage, a multinational team of operatives has to survive long enough to turn the tide of war. And a father and son will discover how to rebuild what was taken from their lives. In book five of the bestselling Awakened series, Jason Tesar\u2019s epic saga escapes the islands of Scandinavia for the dark forests and rugged mountains of Russia in a tense conflict of subterfuge that blurs the boundaries between sci-fantasy and military fiction.",

Through a blend of history, physics, philosophy, and mythic insight, author Curtis E. Coumbe, Ph.D., reveals the patterns that have guided humanity from survival to transcendence. This is more than a history of innovation-it's a blueprint for what comes next. From the invention of language and mathematics to the mysteries of quantum physics and brain-computer interfaces, Coumbe invites readers into a transformative journey across time, consciousness, and the digital frontier. From Fire to AI dares to ask not just how far we've come... but who we are becoming.",

How about awakened after a dream that seemed so real that it took you a few minutes to realize it was just a dream? Divine Intervention: One Man's Story is a journey of amazing real-life situations that not only saved the life of the author but also possibly saved the lives of others. Each chapter details encounters that can only be explained as God's divine grace, as well as divine connections that pushed the author to levels in life not ever imagined. Each story will draw you into his childhood and adult life and open your eyes to your own memories of when God stepped in for you. Is it possible that delay kept you from harm? Is that dream that seems so real a dream to help comfort you in a given situation? This biblical perspective of God's grace shares verses to tell you of his greatness and his timing in our lives. It's not about our timing; it's God's timing that will get us through life and to the destination he has planned for you. Are you ready for this great journey--life?",

Harry Potter has never even heard of Hogwarts when the letters start dropping on the doormat at number four, Privet Drive. Addressed in green ink on yellowish parchment with a purple seal, they are swiftly confiscated by his grisly aunt and uncle. Then, on Harry's eleventh birthday, a great beetle-eyed giant of a man called Rubeus Hagrid bursts in with some astonishing news: Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. An incredible adventure is about to begin! Having become classics of our time, the Harry Potter eBooks never fail to bring comfort and escapism. With their message of hope, belonging and the enduring power of truth and love, the story of the Boy Who Lived continues to delight generations of new readers.",

      "description": "Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger and a snake surrounding a large letter 'H'. Harry Potter has never even heard of Hogwarts when the letters start dropping on the doormat at number four, Privet Drive. Addressed in green ink on yellowish parchment with a purple seal, they are swiftly confiscated by his grisly aunt and uncle. Then, on Harry's eleventh birthday, a great beetle-eyed giant of a man called Rubeus Hagrid bursts in with some astonishing news: Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. An incredible adventure is about to begin! Having become classics of our time, the Harry Potter eBooks never fail to bring comfort and escapism. With their message of hope, belonging and the enduring power of truth and love, the story of the Boy Who Lived continues to delight generations of new readers.",
